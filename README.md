# cluster_maker

`cluster_maker` is a small educational Python package for simulating clustered
datasets and running clustering analyses with a simple, user-friendly interface.

It is designed for practicals and exams where students are given an incomplete
or faulty version of the package and asked to debug or extend it.

## Allowed libraries

The package only uses:

- Python standard library  
- NumPy  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- SciPy  
- scikit-learn  

No other third-party libraries are required.

## Main features

- Define a **seed DataFrame** describing cluster centres  
- Simulate clustered data around these centres  
- Compute basic **descriptive statistics** and **correlations**  
- Preprocess data: feature selection and standardisation  
- Run clustering with:
  - a simple **manual K-means** implementation  
  - a scikit-learn **KMeans** wrapper  
- Evaluate clustering with:
  - **inertia** (within-cluster sum of squares)  
  - **silhouette score**  
  - **elbow curve** for K selection  
- Plot:
  - 2D cluster scatter with optional centroids  
  - elbow curve  
- High-level **`run_clustering`** interface  
- Demo scripts and unit tests

## Package root directory structure

- `cluster_maker/`
  - `dataframe_builder.py` – build seed DataFrame and simulate clustered data  
  - `data_analyser.py` – descriptive statistics and correlation  
  - `data_exporter.py` – CSV and formatted text export  
  - `preprocessing.py` – feature selection and standardisation  
  - `algorithms.py` – manual K-means and scikit-learn KMeans wrapper  
  - `evaluation.py` – inertia, silhouette, elbow curve  
  - `plotting_clustered.py` – 2D cluster plots and elbow plots  
  - `interface.py` – high-level `run_clustering` function  
- `demo/` – example scripts  
- `tests/` – basic unit tests using the standard library `unittest`

## Installation (local use)

From the root directory of the project, run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This installs the package in editable mode, meaning you can modify the files
and re-run tests or demos without reinstalling.

## Notes on pyproject.toml and the *.egg-info directory

This project includes a small file named pyproject.toml.
You do not need to open or edit it. Its only purpose is to tell Python/pip
that this folder is a valid installable package. Without it, the command
pip install -e . would fail.

When you run the installation command, pip automatically creates a directory
called something like:

`cluster_maker.egg-info/`

This folder contains package metadata used internally by Python (file lists,
version information, etc.). It is generated automatically and should not be
edited. You can safely ignore it during the mock-practical.
